# Pull Request Guide

The following is a basic guide for creating pull requests for submitting to any of the ERCF repositories such as Mounting and User_Mods.

1. Create a github user if you don't have one already.
2. Browse to the ERCF github repo, either User_Mods or Mounting.
3. On the top right, click on 'Fork'.
4. It will process for a few seconds, then return back with a fork of the selected repository.  The owner will no longer be 'ERCF', but the user who forked the repository.
5. Make the desired changes to the local / forked repository.  This can be done from the web UI or the command line.
6. Be sure to create a commit.  This actually adds the files to the request.
7. Return back to the main Voron Designs repo by clicking the link next to "forked from ERCF/"
8. Select Pull Requests and click the New Pull Request button.
9. Select Compare Across Forks and select your repository.
10. Give a title for your pull request and fill out the form.
11. Click Create Pull Request. It will be submitted and will be manually reviewed.
