This is a community-born project and a major update to the Voron ERCF MMU that was started a couple of years ago by Ette. It is endorsed by Ette, and the guiding philosophy wasn't to start again with a new MMU design but to refine what has already proven to be a very capable machine and push it to be the best it can be by simplifying problematic construction, improving reliability and aligning as close as possible to v2.0 BOM. The project includes an optional integrated filament buffer system (ERCT), filament cutter option (ERF), a collection of recommended tool head sensor modifications and a bit of Bling! It fully leverages the Happy Hare firmware MMU control software with Klipper Screen extensions.
<p>
 
There is a rapidly growing list of MMUs in the marketplace, from the mass-produced "Fords" who pioneered the market to the "Toyota" that are more recent efficient engineering feat but somehow lacked soul. We consider ERCFv3.0 the "BMW" - a little over-engineered perhaps but distinctively cool, and you feel good driving it. We hope you enjoy it!

<td width=45%><img src="/Assets/main_hero_v3.png">An MMU or Multimaterial Unit/Upgrade allows for the automatic change of filaments on your 3D printer.

## Optional Enraged Rabbit Components

The ERCF ecosystem includes several options to allow you to customize to your specific needs:

#### Filament Buffer/Rewinder Systems
When an MMU changes tool, the unloaded filament needs to be thoughtfully managed so that it doesn't tangle. The ERCF project provides two such systems. The best choice for you will depend on your specific setup:

<tr>
<td width=30%><img src="Assets/ERCT_render.png" alt='ERCT'></td>
<td>
The Enraged Rabbit Cotton Tail (ERCT) buffer system is designed to attach directly to ERCF v3.0. It is a passive system that optimizes space and is also designed to reduce resistance in the filament path, creating a consistent system for calibration.
<p>

ERCT includes a pre-gate filament sensor for automated filament loading and detect runout for endless spool feature. It also incorporates a NEOpixel on each gate that, when driven by the Happy Hare firmware, provides functional feedback and the necessary "bling!"
<p>

ERCT is a very compact and integrated buffer system that is great when your spools are remote from your printer.

### <img src="Assets/Carrot.png" alt="" width="24"> Enraged Rabbit Filamentalist - Filament Rewinder
<table>
<tr>
<td>
The Enraged Rabbit Filamentalist is an combined solution for buffering AND spool holder and thus provides total space savings. Rather than containing the unwound coils of filament it instead rewinds the filament back onto the spool which means there are never loose filament coils to tangle.
<p>

Filamentalist requires no additional motors because of its innovation of using the gear stepper of the MMU coupled through the filament to power both feeding and rewinding the spool. This can help overcome friction but caution is recommended for really soft TPU.
<p>

Filamentalist can also use the modular pre-gate filament sensor and gate entry LED blocks from ERCT so you don't give up on bling!

Before the MMU can unload a filament, the tip must be prepared so that it can be cleanly loaded next time. This tip-forming process is very difficult to tune and varies based on material type, temperature, hotend type and even weather! Introducing Enraged Rabbit Filametrix (ERF) filament cutting system. This lightweight addition to your Stealthburner toolhead adds a cutting blade. When retracting, the problematic tip of the filament is simply cut off for perfect tips and no jams.
<p>

ERF also supports an optional servo operated ganrtry activation pin so no print area is lost with this addition. ERF designs also include the recommended integrated toolhead sensor

### <img src="Assets/Carrot.png" alt="" width="24"> Toolhead Sensor Modifications
<table>
<tr>
<td>
ERCF can be operated without a toolhead sensor (filament detection) in the toolhead but it is **not recommended**. A toolhead sensor provides an accurate homing point very close to the nozzle but also adds reliability to the tool change process. ERCF includes a set of toolhead sensor modifications for popular extruders. These work reliably through coupling a microswitch to the filament path.

### Purge System (Blobifier)
<table>
<tr>
<td width=30%><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dendrowen/Blobifier/main/Pictures/Render_Base.png" alt='Blobifier'></td>
<td>

The Blobifier is a small device that eliminates the need for a purgeblock, making filament swaps quicker. It does this by extruding filament onto a tray creating a blob that will get ejected into a purge-bucket.<br />

<h3>Features</h3>

- Turn your filament purge into blobs for less waste and quicker purging.<br />
- Store the blobs in a bucket that can hold 400 blobs!<br />
- Automatically pause the printer once the bucket is full.<br />
- Detect when the bucket is installed or missing.<br />
- Shake the bucket for better dispersion of the blobs in the bucket.<br />
- Clean your nozzle on a brass brush before resuming to print.<br />

ERCF is designed to be used with the Happy Hare MMU firmware for Klipper which adds a set of klipper extensions for configuration setup, testing and operation of ERCF. These commands are available through the command line or macros but are perhaps best operated with an interactive UI with the optional KlipperScreen extension.
<p>

Happy Hare provides an easy installation script which has knowledge of recommended settings and will greatly accelerate the setup process.

## Documentation

Building something as complex as an MMU is a challenging undertaking, but the ERCFv3.0 project contains an amazingly detailed and illustrated manual with step-by-step instructions. We have tried to make the process similar to fitting together a jigsaw puzzle, albeit with a few optional pieces.

## BOM

You can find a Bill of Materials (BOM) and a convenient printed parts tracker for the project and options here. Note that the BOM also contains an upgrade list for those of you who want to use your existing ERCF v1.1 kits. Please make a copy and edit the "Filament Blocks #" to be the number of gates for your build. This can be any number, but we encourage kit vendors to use 4/8/12 as size variations. Note that there are separate columns for core ERCF, the optional ERCT and ERF options, as well as the suggested "extras"
<p>
Please be aware that the BOM is strictly for reference. The recommended parts can be exchanged for other similar quality parts. Manufacturers who use the BOM as a reference must submit an application for certification before selling them as ERCF v3.0 kits. Please contact us for certification.

## FAQ
ERCF v3 is currently at the fourth iteration or v3.0 phase. Design evolution has required some BOM changes over v2.0. We're sure there will be lots of questions. To avoid repetition on the various support channels, you can find a list of [frequently asked questions](FAQ.md) here. If something isn't answered the best place to go is the primary [ERCF Discord Server](https://discord.com/channels/1267663557999329371/1310278996503826585)
